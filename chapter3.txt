This is the third chapter and it's time to heal. I think you need to move on to another girl and just work on yourself. I wouldn't particularly say that I want to be in a relationship right now. But I want someone to just recognise and reflect my efforts.
Medha and I can be friends but I wouldn't say it's necessary.

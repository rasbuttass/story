Ok so this is the second chapter of the breakup. Now sometimes I want to believe that she liked me and wanted to be in a relationship with me but what the hell, maybe she just didn't 
Now I don't have to feel bad about it because I tried as much as I could and things just didn't go as planned. 
I maybe I was to accomodating and that made things very awkward.
Her not being free was just a way to say "I'm not there for you so you better leave me." and so I think I took the signal a little late but here we are.
